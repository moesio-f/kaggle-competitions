# (Possible) Solutions for Kaggle Competitions

This repository contains a collection of solutions I came up with for some Kaggle competitions. The code is made publicly available after the competition submission deadline. 

## Structure

The repository is organized with the following convention:

```
.
├── <Competition A>/
│   ├── notebooks/
│   │   └── <files>.ipynb
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── <competition_id>/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── README.md
│   └── pyproject.toml
└── <Competition B>/
    ├── notebooks/
    │   └── <files>.ipynb
    ├── data/
    │   └── ...
    ├── src/
    │   └── <competition_id>/
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── ...
    ├── README.md
    └── pyproject.toml
```

Every competition directory is self-contained, and might use different Python/libraries versions.
